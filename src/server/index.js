// Welcome! beep-beep is a very basic proof-of-concept networking system for
// p2p applications.
//
// What I wanted to try is ..
//
// * Servers are the actual nodes of this network, they handle discovery of
// other nodes and replicate / synchronize data with them. Clients are
// "consumers" of server data with a simple API (maybe GraphQL?).
//
// * The systems allows both federated or "fully" decentralized setups or
// hybrids of both worlds. It is up to the users to decide how they want to
// participate in the network. They can choose a client which uses a "home
// server" to get their data from or a full-stack setup where the server lives
// on the same machine as the client.
//
// * Identities are symmetric keypairs stored inside the clients. The keys are
// used to sign messages in the clients which are then sent to and stored in an
// append-only-log data structure in the servers database. Through verification
// methods we can make sure sent messages belong to one log.
//
// * This setup allows clients in the browser without any need to install a
// server or heavy cryptographic hashing inside the client.
//
// * There is a protocol for server-server and server-client communication.
// Similar to ActivityPub.
//
// Let's start!

const path = require('path');

const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const express = require('express');

const API = require('./api');
const Node = require('./node');

// Create a server Node, which is the actual participant in the p2p network:
const node = new Node();

// Start a simple HTTP server which hosts the static-page client (this is not a
// requirement, you could host the client anywhere) and create the API routes
// which give us a simple interface to post new messages or query the database
// for data we want to display to the user.
const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.use('/', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'client')));
app.use('/api', new API(node));

// The port is 0 as we just take any free port on your machine. This allows you
// to easily start multiple nodes for testing.
const server = app.listen(0, () => {
  // Get the choosen port ..
  const { port } = server.address();

  // .. and start to announce it in the network
  node.start(port);

  console.log(`Server started on port http://localhost:${port}`);
});
